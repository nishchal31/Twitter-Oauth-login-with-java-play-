<b>Details of Twitter Oauth login implementation:</b>
 Â <p>

- First created an application on twitter which is needed to authorise user using twitter to our implemented web app. You can create twitter app at:
  href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new"
- When your twitter app is created you can see his created app in My apps: href="https://apps.twitter.com/"
- Then entering into your twitter application, you can see "keys and access token" link, where lies your "CONSUMER KEY" and "CONSUMER   SECRET".
